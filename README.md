# Amazon Product Sales Analysis
### Description
The Amazon Product Sales Analysis Project aims to explore, clean, analyze, and visualize sales data from Amazon to uncover key business insights and support data-driven decision-making. The project integrates the power of Python for data cleaning and analysis with Power BI for creating interactive and dynamic visual dashboards.

The primary objective of this project was to make raw sales data easily understandable, insightful, and actionable. The dataset included various product-related attributes such as product name, category, price, rating, number of reviews, and sales figures. Initially, the data required extensive cleaning and preprocessing - handling missing values, removing duplicates, formatting inconsistent entries, and converting data types to ensure accuracy and reliability. This process was carried out using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for basic data manipulation and visualization.

After cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to identify trends and patterns within the data. Key analyses included understanding sales distribution across different categories, determining top-selling and underperforming products, analyzing customer preferences based on ratings and reviews, and exploring price-to-sales relationships. Statistical and graphical analysis helped uncover insights such as which product categories contribute the most to revenue, how discounts and pricing affect sales volume, and what customer feedback indicates about product quality.

The final phase of the project involved creating interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize these insights. Charts such as bar graphs, line plots, treemaps, and KPI cards were used to represent sales performance, revenue trends, and customer engagement metrics. These dashboards provide users with an intuitive interface to explore the data and derive insights in real time without requiring technical expertise.

Overall, this project demonstrates the complete data analytics workflow - from data cleaning and transformation to visualization and interpretation - using modern analytical tools. It highlights how effective use of Python and Power BI can transform raw data into meaningful business intelligence that supports strategic decision-making and performance optimization.
